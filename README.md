# User Session Management System

## Overview

This project is a web application for managing user sessions. It includes features for scheduling, rescheduling, and canceling sessions, with a frontend built using React and Tailwind CSS, and a backend powered by Express and MongoDB. 

## Features

- **User Dashboard**: View and manage upcoming sessions.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage sessions, reschedule, and cancel them.
- **Session Scheduling**: Create new sessions and handle conflicts.
- **Session Management**: Reschedule and cancel sessions with appropriate notifications.

## Architecture

The system consists of two main components:

### Frontend

- **React**: Used for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the components.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **React Modal**: For displaying modals.

### Backend

- **Express**: For handling HTTP requests and routing.
- **MongoDB**: For storing session and user data.
- **Mongoose**: For interacting with MongoDB and defining data models.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 14.x)
- npm (>= 6.x)
- MongoDB (installed and running)

### Frontend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>



Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the frontend directory with the following content:

bash
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
Run the Development Server

bash
Copy code
npm start
The frontend application should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Backend Setup
Navigate to the Backend Directory

bash
Copy code
cd backend
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the backend directory with the following content:

bash
Copy code
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/user-sessions
PORT=5000
Run the Development Server

bash
Copy code
npm start
The backend server should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

API Endpoints
POST /api/sessions/create: Create a new session.
GET /api/sessions/user/
: Get sessions for a specific user.
POST /api/sessions/schedule: Schedule a new session.
PUT /api/sessions/update/
: Update an existing session.
DELETE /api/sessions/delete/
: Delete a session.
Design Choices
Frontend Framework: React was chosen for its component-based architecture, which facilitates the development of interactive UIs. Tailwind CSS was used for utility-first styling, allowing for rapid UI adjustments.

Backend Framework: Express was selected for its simplicity and flexibility in creating RESTful APIs. MongoDB was used due to its flexibility with schema design, which fits well with the session data model.

Data Handling: Axios is used for HTTP requests due to its promise-based API, which simplifies asynchronous data fetching. Error handling is implemented to manage failed requests gracefully.

Session Management: Sessions are managed through CRUD operations on the backend, with conflict detection during scheduling to prevent overlapping sessions.
